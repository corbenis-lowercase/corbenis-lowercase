I am corbenis. 
- Graduated from University of California, Davis with a B.S. in Animal Science in March 2022.
- Was accepted to vet school in summer of 2022.
- Turned down my seat at vet school to try my hand at a programming career with no prior experience or knowledge.
- Currently teaching myself Python.

Surprised where I am, don't know where I'll end up, but having a great time learning.
